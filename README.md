# balcony.environment.localhost - Local Development Environment

## Project Overview

The `balcony.environment.localhost` component provides a set of simple Ansible playbooks designed to run directly on the local host system. This component serves as an introduction to AdministrationAsCode practices, allowing administrators to execute infrastructure management tasks on their local development environment without requiring remote system access or inventory management.

### Purpose
- Local host infrastructure management and testing
- Introduction to AdministrationAsCode practices for administrators
- Package management and system maintenance on localhost
- Development environment validation and testing
- Learning platform for Ansible automation techniques

### Key Features
- **Localhost Execution**: All playbooks run directly on the local system without inventory files
- **Package Management**: Complete package lifecycle management (install, update, query)
- **System Maintenance**: Package cache management and system updates
- **Development Focus**: Perfect for learning and testing Ansible automation
- **No Remote Access**: No SSH keys, inventory files, or remote system configuration required
- **Immediate Feedback**: Instant results on the local development system
- **VS Code Integration**: Pre-configured tasks for easy execution within VS Code
- **Workflow Automation**: Built-in maintenance and audit workflows

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Local Linux system (Ubuntu/Debian/RHEL/CentOS)
- Ansible installed on the local system
- Administrative privileges (sudo) for package management operations
- Internet connectivity for package updates and installations

### Dependencies
- **None**: This is a standalone component for localhost development
- **Ansible**: Must be installed on the local system
- **Package Manager**: System package manager (apt, yum, dnf) must be functional

### Variables
No external variables required - all operations target localhost directly.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. System Connectivity Test
```bash
# Test basic Ansible connectivity to localhost
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.ping.yaml
```

### 2. Package Information Gathering
```bash
# Get current package information
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.get.packages.yaml
```

### 3. Package Cache Management
```bash
# Update package cache (requires sudo)
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.update.packages.cache.yaml -K
```

### 4. Package Update Operations
```bash
# Check for upgradable packages
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.upgradable.packages.yaml

# Update packages (requires sudo)
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.update.packages.yaml -K
```

## Example Usage

## Quick Start

## Usage Examples

### Complete Local System Maintenance Workflow
```bash
# Full localhost maintenance sequence

# 1. Test system connectivity
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.ping.yaml

# 2. Get current package status
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.get.packages.yaml

# 3. Update package cache
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.update.packages.cache.yaml -K

# 4. Check for available updates
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.upgradable.packages.yaml

# 5. Apply package updates
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.update.packages.yaml -K
```

### Learning and Development Workflow
```bash
# Perfect for learning AdministrationAsCode

# Start with basic connectivity
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.ping.yaml

# Explore package management
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.get.packages.yaml

# Practice with package operations
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.update.packages.cache.yaml -K
```

### System Maintenance Examples
```bash
# Daily maintenance routine
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.update.packages.cache.yaml -K
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.upgradable.packages.yaml

# Weekly update routine  
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.update.packages.yaml -K

# System status check
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.ping.yaml
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.get.packages.yaml
```

## Integration

### Component Dependencies
This component works independently but integrates well with:
- **balcony.core.code**: Development environment setup and VS Code integration
- **balcony.linux.packages**: Advanced package management for remote systems
- **balcony.linux.facts**: System information collection for localhost

### Development Environment Integration
- **VS Code**: Perfect for testing playbooks in the integrated terminal
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI assistance for learning Ansible syntax and best practices
- **YAML Extensions**: Syntax highlighting and validation for playbook development
- **Ansible Extensions**: IntelliSense and syntax support for Ansible development

### Learning Path Integration
1. **Start Here**: Learn basic Ansible concepts with localhost execution
2. **Progress To**: balcony.core.code for full development environment
3. **Advance To**: Remote system management with other balcony components
4. **Master**: Full infrastructure automation across the balcony ecosystem

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Permission Denied**: Ensure sudo access for package management operations
- **Package Manager Locked**: Check for other package management processes running
- **Network Connectivity**: Verify internet access for package updates
- **Ansible Not Found**: Ensure Ansible is properly installed on localhost

### Verification Steps
```bash
# Check Ansible installation
ansible --version

# Test localhost connectivity
ansible localhost -m ping

# Check sudo access
sudo echo "Sudo access confirmed"

# Verify package manager functionality
apt list --upgradable  # Ubuntu/Debian
yum check-update       # RHEL/CentOS
```

### Performance Tips
```bash
# Speed up operations with parallel execution
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.ping.yaml --forks=10

# Use verbose output for debugging
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.get.packages.yaml -v

# Check playbook syntax before execution
ansible-playbook playbook.environment.localhost.ping.yaml --syntax-check
```
